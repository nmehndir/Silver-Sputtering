# Silver-Sputtering
Control PVD process to deposit 1-micron-thick Ag layer onto HTS tape.
HTS tapes can suddenly lose superconductivity during a quench. Resulting excess temperatures can cause damage to the tapes.
A conductive layer (typically Ag or Cu) attached on top bypasses electrical current during quench, and also protects against harsh environmental conditions.
